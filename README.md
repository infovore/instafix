Instafix
========

Removing all the junk from Instagram uploads.

Configuration
-------------

FLICKR_API_KEY and FLICKR_SHARED_SECRET should be set as environment variables
(because we're going to run on heroku). Given that: stick them a .env file and
run the whole shebang through foreman. Also, set them up in your Heroku app
properly.
