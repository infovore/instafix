%h1 Instafix

%p Instafix makes it easy to replace all the ridiculous tags Instagram automatically adds to your Flickr photos.

%p Once you've logged in with your Flickr ID, you can see every photo you've uploaded to Flickr via Instagram. Then, you can alter them all in one fell swoop - adding titles, descriptions, and tags. There are convenient functions to remove the noise Instagram adds.

%p You can also choose to hide a photo from Instafix when it's edited - meaning you'll only see photos you want to edit.

%p To use Instafix, you'll need to sign in with Flickr:

.sign-in-button
  .btn= link_to "Sign in to Flickr", photos_path
